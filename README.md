# Oasis Infobyte Task 3
## Sales Prediction with Python

## Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict sales based on advertising expenditure on TV, Radio, and Newspaper. We use a Linear Regression Model to analyze the impact of different advertising channels on sales performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on advertising expenses for three media platforms:
- TV advertising budget
- Radio advertising budget
- Newspaper advertising budget
- Sales (Target variable)

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates future sales based on the given advertising budget for TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

## Technologies Used

- Pandas (Data processing)

- NumPy (Numerical computations)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning framework)

## Model

We use Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression models to analyze and predict sales.

## Steps Involved

- Data Preprocessing

- Load the dataset

- Handle missing values

- Perform exploratory data analysis 

- Visualize relationships between features and target variable

## Model Training

- Split data into training and testing sets

- Train the Linear Regression model

- Evaluate model performance using R-squared score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- Model Prediction

- Use the trained model to predict sales based on new advertising budgets

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

## Results & Performance

- The model provides an estimate of sales based on given advertising budgets.

- The R-squared value determines how well the model fits the data.

- The model can be improved by feature engineering and testing different regression techniques.

## Future Improvements

Experiment with Polynomial Regression to capture non-linearity.

Use Feature Selection to remove less important variables.

Try Regularized Regression (Ridge, Lasso) to prevent overfitting.

Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-world use.
